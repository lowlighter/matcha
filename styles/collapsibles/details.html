        <li>This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.</li>
        <li>If the cause of death is written within the next 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.</li>
        <li>If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.</li>
        <li>After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.</li>
