  <em>matcha.css</em> provides utility classes for added convenience.
</p>
<div class="flash danger">
  <p>
    Utility classes requires that you patch your document to add classes which make it harder to eventually opt-out of <em>matcha.css</em> in the future.
  </p>

    While not neccessarily a bad thing per se, it does diverge from the original intent of <em>matcha.css</em> which aims to be semantic-based.
    Use these only if you plan to stay with <em>matcha.css</em> for the long run.
